## Receiving PDUs

As with sending PDUs, receiving PDUs requires a little socket programming. Create a UDP socket, and then receive a datagram. Extract the payload, and then use the PDUFactory object to convert the DIS-formatted data into a Java object.

The PduFactory object is responsible for parsing the binary data and converting the DIS formatted data into a Java object.

So far we have been putting one DIS PDU in one UDP datagram packet. However, it's relatively expensive to receive datagram packets. In high traffic DIS environments it makes sense to concatenate several PDUs together, and place them all in one datagram packet. This allows us to receive several PDUs for the cost of processing one datagram packet. This is called "PDU Bundling."
